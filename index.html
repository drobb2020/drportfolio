            I own a second domain named oneexcessionlab.tech. I'm using this
            domain as my development platform. Look for more from this domain in
            the future. The name Excession comes from the science fiction novel
            by Iain M. Banks of the same name. This is one of my favorite books.
          </p>
          <p class="featured-desc">
            There's an entry for 'excession' in the Oxford English Dictionary,
            defined as "a going out or forth." The first date of occurrence is
            1655. It comes from the same Latin root as "exceed", in the sense of
            passing a boundary.

              One good thing that came out of the pandemic lock down is that it

              around with Django, and connecting Python to a backend database.

              Marine Engineer with the Canadian Coast Guard
            </p>
            <p class="featured-desc">
              In 1979 after graduating from high school I applied for and was
              accepted into the Marine Engineering program at the Canadian Coast
              College, located in Sydney, Nova Scotia, Canada. The three year
              program trained me in engine operation and maintenance, a full
              range of machine shop operations including working with lathes
              through welding. The academic courses included ship construction
              and architecture, along with electrical theory, and of course
              diesel engine theory and design. The cirriculum was heavy in math,
              physics and chemistry as well. The summer periods between each
              year were spent working in the machine shop, or on sea duty in the
              fleet. At the end of the program I took and passed the fourth
              Class combined Marine Engineering certificate. Upon graduation I
              was assigned to the CCGS Camsell on the west coast of Canada,
              sailing out of Victoria BC. I served on the Camsell initially as
              third engineer, and was promoted to second engineer, and was
              acting as first engineer when I left the ship. During this time I
              spent 3 1/2 summers in the Western Canadian Arctic with the CCGS
              Camsell. I was reassigned to the construction team on the CCGS
              George R. Pearkes in early 1986, and helped commission the ship
              and was first engineer for the first year of the shipâ€™s operation.
              In 1987 I transferred to the East Coast and worked on multiple
              ships as Senior Engineer and a couple of ships as Chief Engineer.
              In 1988 I transferred to the Great Lakes and worked initially in
              the Regional Office and later on all the ships in the region.
              Eventually I was promoted to Chief Engineer of the CCGS Simcoe. I
              finally retired from the sea in 1994. It was a great first career!

              After leaving the Coast Guard I went to the University of Western

              read that correctly. Philosophy trains you how to think and make
              logical arguments. This aspect of philosophy comes in very handy

            <p class="featured-desc">
              Of course there are very few jobs for philosophers, so after
              graduation I went back to technical training and got certified in
              Microsoft and Novell products. I turned this into a job in
              consulting helping customers to install and configure Windows 95,
              and Windows 2000 Server. I quickly became adept with all the
              Novell products (NetWare, BorderManager, GroupWise, and ZENworks).
              Along with others at the same consulting company we made a
              formidable team that could tackle any deployment or upgrade
              project. I moved from consulting into network administration when
              one of my customers realized that they needed me full time. I
              further developed my skills with both Novell and Microsoft
              products, particularly using Novell DirXML (IDM) to connect Novell
              eDirectory to Microsoft Active Directory.

              I thoroughly enjoyed working with the Novell products that when I
              heard a position was open at Novell for a Dedicated Support
              Engineer I applied and was awarded with a job offer. I have been
              working there ever since through two mergers (Attachemate and then
              Micro Focus). Recently I have been expanding my skill set to
              include software that Micro Focus purchased from HPE. I have added
              LoadRunner, UFT, and other performance testing software to my
              resume. And the journey continues.
